## Our Client

> Healthy Families Oregon (HFO) is a free family support and parent education home visiting program.

Healthy Families Oregon (HFO) is a free family support and parent education home visiting program. HFO is voluntary and it focuses on strengthening the parent-child relationship to assure healthy growth and development. Home visitors support parents in cultivating and strengthening a nurturing, positive relationship with their baby at each visit. Parents receive information on topics like child development, infant care, and keeping their baby healthy, and learn what is going on in their communities to support new families. Many families are eligible for home visits with a trained home visitor, who coaches them as they build their skills as parents and help their baby be safe, healthy, and learn.

## My Role

> I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project...

At Vistalogic we had a very small but agile team. I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project and worked together with program managers and the head software architect to transform the clients needs into a compelling and user-friendly user interface for the CLARA software product. Unfortunately, this project did not get to the implementation phase due to budget constraints, but had it moved forward, I would have been the engineer for all aspects of frontend development.

## The Problem

> the system, as it was designed, did not sufficiently match how \[HFO] handled their workflows and processes.

Healthy Families Oregon was already a user of <a href="https://vistalogic.net/Products/Clara" target="_blank">Vistalogic's CLARA system</a>, a technology platform that offers vital data collection and management tools to public agencies, non-profits, and healthcare organizations aiming to provide efficient and compassionate services to their clients. However, the system, as it was designed, did not sufficiently match how they handled their workflows and processes.

Vistalogic had already developed a new “Care Plan” interface, but that was focused on a single client. HFO needed to work on a “Case” level where they would be able to work on multiple clients within a household simultaneously. In addition, we needed to develop new features to support their program which required a pregnant person or a primary caregiver and an infant child in order to be eligible. Finally, we needed to tie the new features together with existing features into a seamless workflow across four different user types.

We identified different users who had distinct roles in the process.

## Requirements Gathering

> I worked with the Program Managers to prioritize the list of 30 requirements and 97 sub-requirments and to identify items that would require intensive design iteration prior to development...

Vistalogic’s Program Managers worked with HFO to develop a list of requirements for the new features that they wanted to build into the CLARA system. They also identified a set of these features that would require design documentation as a deliverable.

I worked with the Program Managers to prioritize the list of 30 requirements and 97 sub-requirments and to identify items that would require intensive design iteration prior to development, whether as a deliverable or to be used internally within Vistalogic. We developed a list of of 19 major requirements that required design exploration and documentation.

## Creating the Design Story

Once we had the requirement set organized and prioritized, I synthesized the work into an overall Design Story that would guide the design process.
