I worked with the design firm [Pandiscio Green](http://pandiscio.green/) to implement their vision for Future Green Studio's new website. This included development of a custom Django Wagtail CMS solution and development of highly responsive HTML / CSS templates including a complex pure CSS mosaic grid for the "People" and "Work" sections of the site.
