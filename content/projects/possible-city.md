Built fully-functional web application using Django, PostGIS, Leaflet, Open Street Maps, and open parcel data from the City of Philadelphia.

Original author of open-source Django package django-rest-framework-gis required to facilitate mapping functionality. I handed it over to a new maintainer and the package now has 51 contributors and 509 commits.

Possible City was a finalist in the 2013 Knight News Challenge on Open Government.
