## My Role

> I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project...

At Vistalogic we had a very small but agile team. I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project, working together with the client and our developers to shape Aware Institute's vision into a successful and compelling software product.

## The Challenge

> Aware had a vision of a management application for zoos to help them track and use scientific principles in the care of their animals.

Aware had a vision of a management application for zoos to help them track and use scientific principles in the care of their animals. They needed an interface which would transform a data-heavy set of metrics into digestible and compelling user interface that zoo's would integrate into their daily management. 

Aware needed an interface through which managers and caregivers could visually enter their housing schedules for all of their animals for the day. Within those housing blocks, they needed to enter different "Events" such as feeding, husbandry, veterinary care, observations, and enrichment.

One of the challenges was to build the interface to be as high fidelity as possible on desktop, but to also work on mobile devices in the field. I designed and built a "Planner" interface that was optimized for desktop and an "Agenda" interface which was tailored for mobile viewing and updating.
