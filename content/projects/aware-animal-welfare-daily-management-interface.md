## Our Client

> Based upon the outcome of this study, Aware developed a set of metrics to assist zoo and research organization in improving the care of their animals.

AWARE Institute is an independent consulting organization with the mission of supporting advancements in animal welfare through assessment, research, and education. They are a group of Phds in animal behavior that consult with zoos and research organizations on how to best care for and enrich the lives of animals in captivity.

Aware founded the Elephant Welfare Initiative (EWI) which came about following the completion of a large-scale North American elephant welfare study (see http://collections.plos.org/elephant-welfare), which demonstrated that daily practices such as social management, enrichment and exercise play a critical role in improving the welfare of zoo elephants.

Based upon the outcome of this study, Aware developed a set of metrics to assist zoo and research organization in improving the care of their animals.

## My Role

> I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project...

At Vistalogic we had a very small but agile team. I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project, working together with the client and our developers to shape Aware Institute's vision into a successful and compelling software product.

## The Challenge

> Aware had a vision of a management application for zoos to help them track and use scientific principles in the care of their animals.

Aware had a vision of a management application for zoos to help them track and use scientific principles in the care of their animals, based on the outcome of their EWI study. They approached Vistalogic to help them develop a system that could facilitate the input of managment data and calculate and display metrics based on this information.  

We were tasked with transforming a data-heavy set of metrics into digestible and compelling user interface that zoo's, who are generally adverse to changes to their daily management approach, would adopt and use consistently. 

In addition, we needed to support an interface that was as high fidelity as possible on desktop, but also would work well on mobile devices in the field.

## Users

We identified four different types of users:

Zoo Keepers (care staff)
Curators (managers)
Directors (supervisors) 
Scientists and researchers use the aggregate data. 
Inspectors (from the accreditation body) review the reports
