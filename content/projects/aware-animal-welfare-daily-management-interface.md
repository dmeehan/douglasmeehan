## Our Client

> AWARE Institute is an independent consulting organization with the mission of supporting advancements in animal welfare through assessment, research, and education.

AWARE Institute is an independent consulting organization with the mission of supporting advancements in animal welfare through assessment, research, and education. They are a group of Phd's in animal behavior that consult with zoos and research organizations on how to best care for and enrich the lives of animals in captivity.

Aware founded the Elephant Welfare Initiative (EWI) following the completion of a large-scale North American elephant welfare study (see http://collections.plos.org/elephant-welfare), which demonstrated that daily practices such as social management, enrichment and exercise play a critical role in improving the welfare of zoo elephants.

Based upon the outcome of this study, Aware developed a set of metrics and methodologies to assist zoo and research organizations in improving the livelihood and care of their animals.

## My Role

> I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project...

At Vistalogic we had a very small but agile team. I was the sole UI designer and front-end developer on this project, working together with the client and our developers to shape Aware Institute's vision into a successful and compelling software product.

## The Challenge

> Aware had a vision of a management application for zoos to help them track and use scientific principles in the care of their animals.

Aware had a vision of a management application for zoos to help them track and use scientific principles in the care of their animals, based on the outcome of their EWI study. They approached Vistalogic to help them develop a system that could facilitate the input of managment data and calculate and display metrics based on this information.  

We were tasked with transforming a data-heavy set of metrics into digestible and compelling user interface that zoo's, who are generally adverse to changes to their daily management approach, would adopt and use consistently. 

In addition, we needed to support an interface that was as high fidelity as possible on desktop, but also would work well on mobile devices in the field.

## Users

We identified four different types of users:

Zoo Keepers (care staff)
Curators (managers)
Directors (supervisors) 
Scientists and researchers use the aggregate data. 
Inspectors (from the accreditation body) review the reports

## Outcome

The application is currently used by 20 zoos and research institutions including San Diego Zoo Global, Oregon Zoo, Saint Louis Zoo, Kansas City Zoo, Sedgwick County Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo, Zoo de Granby, Louisville Zoological Garden, Dickerson Park Zoo, Roger Williams Park Zoo, Buffalo Zoo, Cameron Park Zoo, El Paso Zoo, Fresno Chaffee Zoo, Milwaukee County Zoological Gardens, Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium, Riverbanks Zoo & Garden, Santa Barbara Zoological Gardens, Zoo Atlanta, and Caldwell Zoo.

These zoos have been able to use the software to implement new best-practices for the care of their animals and are seeing measurable improvements in their welfare. For example, after only a few months of using the interface, the team at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden  identified a need for and devised a plan to improve the space and social experience for all elephants. More inside–outside choice is provided, and female elephants are more regularly housed together overnight in larger, connected spaces. As a result, overnight social experience for the herd increased 6%, daytime inside–outside choice for the male increased 14% and night-time space experience increased 29% for two females who were more often provided overnight access to a large outdoor habitat.
