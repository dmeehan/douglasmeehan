HFO Home Visiting 

Client 

Healthy Family Oregon

Role 

Lead designer and developer

Problem

Healthy Families Oregon was already a user of the CLARA system, but the system did not match how they handled their workflows and processes. Healthy Families Oregon has a program where they screen potential clients to determine their eligibility for State social and healthcare services. 

Vistalogic had already developed a new “Care Plan” interface, but that was focused on a single client. HFO needed to work on a “Case” level where they would be able to work on multiple clients within a household simultaneously. In addition, we needed to develop new features to support their program which required a pregnant person or a primary caregiver and an infant child. Finally, we needed to tie the new features together with existing features into a seamless workflow across four different user types. 

Screening => Outreach => Enrollment => Case Management => Supervision

Users

We identified different users who had distinct roles in the process.

Screeners
Program Managers
Home Visitors
Supervisors

Process

Requirements gathering

Vistalogic’s Program Managers worked with HFO to develop a list of requirements for the new features that they wanted to build into the CLARA system. They also identified a set of these features that would require design documentation prior to implementation.

I worked with the Program Managers to prioritize the development of these features and to identify items that would greatly benefit from design documentation prior to development, even if only used internally within Vistalogic. Other features were either backend changes, or were implementation of previously designed components and would not require design work. 

Creating the Design Story

Once we had the requirement set organized and prioritized, I synthesized the work into an overall Design Story that would guide the design process.
